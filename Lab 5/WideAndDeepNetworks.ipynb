    "In January 1922, [Leonard Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Thompson_(diabetic)) was hospitalized in Toronto, Canada. Having been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, a death sentence at the time, the 14 year old Thompson was staring death in the face. Fighting for his life, Thompson received the [first ever injection of insulin](https://diabetes.org/blog/history-wonderful-thing-we-call-insulin); less than 24 hours later, Thompson's blood sugar levels were back to normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the discovery and production of synthetic insulin, people with diabetes can now live relatively normal lives. Nevertheless, diabetes remains a significant health hazard, especially among adults in the United States, where [about 10% of Americans have diabetes and about 33% of Americans have prediabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/spotlights/diabetes-facts-stats.html#:~:text=Key%20findings%20include%3A,t%20know%20they%20have%20it.). To help combat this, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) annually performs \"Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\" (BRFSS) telephone surveys, in which they collect health related data about American adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset, titled \"Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset\", is a cleaned and consolidated subset of the BRFSS dataset from 2015 (i.e., our dataset has no missing data and only contains features that are potentially relevant to diabetes). Our task is to create a Wide and Deep Neural Network that can predict whether someone has diabetes, prediabetes, or neither. \n",
