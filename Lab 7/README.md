# Lab Assignment Seven: Recurrent Network Architectures
In this lab, you will select a prediction task to perform on your dataset, evaluate a recurrent architecture and tune hyper-parameters. If any part of the assignment is not clear, ask the instructor to clarify. 

This report is worth 10% of the final grade. Please upload a report (**one per team**) with all code used, visualizations, and text in a rendered Jupyter notebook. Any visualizations that cannot be embedded in the notebook, please provide screenshots of the output. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully describe every assumption and every step in your report.

**Dataset Selection**

Select a dataset that is text. That is, the dataset should be text data (or a time series sequence). In terms of generalization performance, it is helpful to have a large dataset of similar sized text documents. It is fine to perform binary classification or multi-class classification. The classification can be "many-to-one" or "many-to-many" sequence classification, whichever you feel more comfortable with. 

**Grading Rubric**

- Preparation (**3 points total**)
  - [**1 points**] Define and prepare your class variables. Use proper variable representations (int, float, one-hot, etc.). Use pre-processing methods (as needed). Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a description of any newly formed variables you created). **Discuss methods of tokenization in your dataset as well as any decisions to force a specific length of sequence.** 
  - [**1 points**] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithmâ€™s performance. You should give a **detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate** on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (*e.g.*, in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.
  - [**1 points**] Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing (*i.e.*, are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Shuffle splits? Why?). **Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate.** Convince me that your train/test splitting method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. 
- Modeling (**6 points total**)
  - [**3 points**] Investigate at least two different recurrent network architectures (perhaps LSTM and GRU). Alternatively, you may also choose one recurrent network and one convolutional network. Be sure to use an embedding layer (try to use a pre-trained embedding, if possible). Adjust hyper-parameters of the networks as needed to improve generalization performance (train a total of at least four models). Discuss the performance of each network and compare them.
  - [**1 points**] Using the best parameters and architecture from the RNN in the previous step, add a second recurrent chain to your RNN. The input to the second chain should be the output sequence of the first chain. Visualize the performance of training and validation sets versus the training iterations. 
  - [**2 points**] Use the method of train/test splitting and evaluation criteria that you argued for at the beginning of the lab. Visualize the results of all the RNNs you trained.  Use proper statistical comparison techniques to determine which method(s) is (are) superior.  
- Exceptional Work (**1 points total**)
  - You have free reign to provide additional analyses.
  - One idea (**required for 7000 level students to do one of these options**):
    - Use the ConceptNet Numberbatch embedding and compare to GloVe. Which method is better for your specific application? 
  - Another Idea (NOT required): Try to create a RNN for generating novel text.
